Software Requirements:

Python 3: The code is written in Python and requires Python 3 to be installed on the laptop. You can check if Python 3 is installed by opening a terminal or command prompt and typing python3 --version. If Python 3 is not installed, it can be downloaded for free from https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/

tkinter library: The code uses the tkinter library, which is a Python library for creating graphical user interfaces (GUIs). In most cases, tkinter comes pre-installed with Python 3. However, if it's not installed, you can install it using the following command in your terminal or command prompt:


Bash

pip install tkinter



Hardware Requirements:

Processor: The code doesn't require a high-performance processor. A basic modern laptop processor will be sufficient to run the game smoothly.

Memory (RAM): The code's memory requirements are minimal. A few MB of RAM is enough to run the game.

Storage: The code itself is a small text file and won't take up much storage space.

Operating System: The code should run on most popular operating systems that support Python 3, including Windows, macOS, and Linux.

Additional Considerations:

Permissions: No special permissions are required to run the code.

Internet Connection: An internet connection is not required to run the game itself. However, an internet connection might be helpful if you need to download Python or the tkinter library.

In summary, the requirements to run this Python Number Guessing Game on a laptop are very minimal. With Python 3 and the tkinter library installed (if not pre-installed), the game should run on most modern laptops.
